# id_verification_example
This is an example app for Intercom's identify verification feature using Python and Flask

To use this, replace these constants with your app-specific values:

```
ID_VERIFICATION_SECRET = ""
APP_ID = ""
```

Then execute

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo app.py
```
Your app will now be viewable on `localhost`
